# Prototype 1: Roll-and-Survive

## Overview
Roll-and-Survive is a game project inspired by the classic roll-a-ball project. The main goal of the game is to survive as long as possible against an enemy that shoots projectiles. Instead of collecting objects (like in ApplePicker and roll-a-ball), your objective is to avoid the enemy's projectiles and maximize your survival time.

## Features
- Player-controlled ball for movement.
- Dynamic perspective changes for an immersive experience.
- Enemy that shoots projectiles to challenge the player.
- Scoring system based on the player's survival time (in seconds).

## Gameplay
Navigate your ball through the game environment, avoiding projectiles launched by the enemy. The longer you survive, the higher your score.

## Design Frameworks
The design of Roll-and-Survive is influenced by principles of MDA. As the project is rather on the simpler side (due to it being a prototype), my main example of this is: Surviving -> Updated Highscore -> Satisfied Player for achieving a new score.
